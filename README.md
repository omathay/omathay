### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Owen (he/him) and I'm a Computer Science & Music Technology major. I'm looking for a co-op for the duration of Spring 2024.

### About me

I'm a third year student at Northeastern University. I transferred as a sophomore from the Rochester Institute of Technology because Northeastern aligned better with my goal of incorporating both tech and music into my career. Currently, I'm taking Object-Oriented Design (CS 3500) and Digital Audio Signal Processing (MUST 3601) to better prepare me for co-op. I'm also designing a mobile metronome app to help my sister practice music more without having to pay for accesss.
